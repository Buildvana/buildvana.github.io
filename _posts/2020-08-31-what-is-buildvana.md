Buildvana (_/bɪldˈvɑːnə/_) is a method. It's how I work, distilled.

It's also meant to be a work in progress: as I learn and test new procedures and tools, I'm going to add them to Buildvana.

I'm going to document my progress on this blog.

As you may have guessed, I suck at blogging. Maybe I'll improve a bit along the way.

And that's all for a first post. (Hey, I told you I suck at blogging.)
