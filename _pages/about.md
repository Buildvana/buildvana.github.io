## What is Buildvana

Buildvana is, first of all, a state of mind.

You have reached Buildvana when your toolchain works for you, not against you; when said toolchain is mostly invisible and can be configured in a simple and reliable manner using just text files; when you may concentrate on writing software, not scripts - and still deploy like a pro, with good practices automatically implemented for you.

The Buildvana project is an effort to achieve out-of-the-box, automated DevOps for .NET projects, enforcing good practices while avoiding any waste of time.

It includes a [MSBuild SDK](https://github.com/Buildvana/Buildvana.Sdk), a series of template repositories to get new projects set up in no time, and this repository to hold documentation about the projects, as well as the methods and processes involved.

All Buildvana projects are released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).

**NOTE:** Buildvana is still a work in progress, so all standard disclaimers apply. However, it was already used for internal projects at Tenacom, before it even became a project of its own.

### Who's behind Buildvana

I am Riccardo De Agostini, a professional software developer hailing from nothern Italy. Although I started Buildvana as a one-man project, I look forward to other people joining me and bringing the project forward together.

Although there's no contributing guide yet, you can [email me](mailto:team@buildvana.net) or [join me on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/buildvana/shared_invite/zt-e667rvy8-hCtADFiuF8OuiYvthIiWVw) if you are interested.

### Why Buildvana

After nearly 30 years writing software, both professionally and for personal pleasure, I have lost count of the times open-source software has saved my day. Buildvana is one of the ways through which I'm trying to give something back.

### Who should use Buildvana

The typical Buildvana user is a freelance developer or small team, with no dedicated DevOps personnel and no time to waste. The project's main focus is on open-source, but private projects are supported too.

Buildvana is also good for hobby or side projects that have growth potential, as they'll be ready to scale up when it's time.

### The Buildvana method

Buildvana is not only software, and as far as software goes, it is strongly opinionated. The use of Buildvana implies specfic ways to manage a project, from versioning to branching to handling pull requests and so on. The set of procedures involved, which will be described in Buildvana's documentation, constitutes the **Buildvana method** and reflects, at least in part, how we work at Tenacom.

## What Buildvana is NOT

Buildvana is not meant to solve all problems for everybody:

- if you have a DevOps team, a testing team, and a QA team, you've already outgrown Buildvana's target by a long shot;
- if you follow Agile methodologies, you might find the Buildvana method to be a bad fit, although you're welcome to use any Buildvana project you deem useful;
- if you are a hobbyist, working alone on very small projects, you may find Buildvana a bit overkill at first, but you're warmly invited to try it nonetheless.
